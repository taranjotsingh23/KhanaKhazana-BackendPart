# The problem Khana Khazana solves
"Over 20 crore Indians go to sleep empty-stomach every day and around 172,000 tons of food gets wasted everyday."
Despite the abundance of food in many countries, food insecurity and food waste remain persistent issues, with millions of people going hungry while food goes to waste. This is caused by a lack of effective and efficient systems for surplus food recovery and distribution.

The current food recovery systems often rely on manual and fragmented processes, leading to inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and food waste. The gap between surplus food from the food industry and those in need remains unaddressed, resulting in a waste of valuable resources and a failure to support local communities.

This is why we need a solution that addresses the root causes of food waste and food insecurity. Our food donation website aims to connect food industry donors with non-profit organizations and social volunteers to streamline the food donation process and match surplus food with those in need. By reducing food waste and supporting local communities, we can help create a more sustainable and equitable future.

# Challenges we ran into
Integration with different stakeholders - Ensuring seamless integration between food industry, NGOs, and volunteers was a major challenge we faced.

Technical complexities - Implementing features like food tracking and donation management required a lot of technical expertise. Deploying on Replit was not an easier task when it comes to MERN stack Development.

Integration- We never worked with integrating backend and frontend MERN together, so that was a major area were we faced a lot of issue and also creating a dashboard for both ngo and restaurant was on of the major task we came across

Designing an intuitive user interface - Making the website easy to use for all stakeholders was a challenge that required careful consideration of user needs and feedback.

Designing a blog page- We have never worked with creating a blog website before also, so that another major challenge for us, but we are in it to learn and grow.
